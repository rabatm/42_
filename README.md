# Push Swap: An Algorithmic Project

Push Swap is an algorithmic project within the study program at School 42 (UNIT Factory). The main objective is to sort data using a stack and a limited set of instructions while minimizing the number of actions required.

## Project Overview
Goal: Sort a set of integers using two stacks (named ‘a’ and ‘b’) and a predefined set of instructions.
### Instructions:

**sa** : Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack ‘a’.\
**sb** : Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack ‘b’.\
**ss** : Perform sa and sb simultaneously.\
**pa** : Push the first element from stack ‘b’ to stack ‘a’.\
**pb** : Push the first element from stack ‘a’ to stack ‘b’.\
**ra** : Rotate all elements of stack ‘a’ (shift up by 1).\
**rb** : Rotate all elements of stack ‘b’ (shift up by 1).\
**rr** : Perform ra and rb simultaneously.\
**rra**: Reverse rotate stack ‘a’ (shift down by 1).\
**rrb**: Reverse rotate stack ‘b’ (shift down by 1).\
**rrr**: Perform rra and rrb simultaneously.\
